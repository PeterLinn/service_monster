## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'service_monster'

And then execute:

## Usage

### Configuration

Before you can make calls to ServiceMonster you must configure the library with a valid API Token. You can request
a token be generated by ServiceMonster. The API Token ties the API request to a particualr ServiceMonster company id.

There are two ways to configure the ServiceMonster gem. You can pass a hash of configuration options when you create
a client, or you can use a configure block.

```ruby
client = ServiceMonster.client({api_token: "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"})
```

```ruby
ServiceMonster.configure do |config|
  config.api_token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
end

client = ServiceMonster.client
```

### Parameters

ServiceMonster supports several parameters that can be passed to their API to change the results you receive.

* **q:** Search term. Supply this parameter with a value to return results on which this search term matches at least one of the fields.
* **fields:** Field list. Supply a comma separated list of fields you would like to be returned. See http://developer.servicemonster.net/Documentation.aspx?ID=1 for a list of resources and the available fields for each.
* **limit:** The number of records to return in the result. Defaults to 10.
* **page:** The page of data to return in the result. Defaults to the first page of data.
